        <!-- Wherever you can use a number, you can use a math expression. For
        example, you're familiar with this kind of statement. <br />
        var popularNumber = 4; <br />
        But you can also write this. <br />
        var popularNumber = 2 + 2; <br />
        You can also write: <br />
        alert(2 + 2); <br />
        This displays the messge "4" in an alert box. <br />
        When it sees a math expression, JavaScript always does the math and
        delivers the result. <br />
        Here's a statement that subtracts 24 from 12, assigning -12 to the
        variable. <br />
        var popularNumber = 12 - 24; <br />
        This one assigns the product of 3 times 12, 36, to the variable. <br />
        var popularNumber = 3 * 12; <br />
        In this one, the number 10 is assigned to a variable. <br />
        Then 1 is added to the variable, and the sum, 210, is assigned to a
        second variable. As usual, you can mix variables and numbers. <br />
        1 var num = 10; <br />
        2 var popularNumber = num + 200; <br />
        You can also use nothing but variables. <br />
        1 var num = 10; <br />
        2 var anotherNum = 1; <br />
        3 var popularNumber = num + anotherNum; <br />
        The arithmetic operators I've been using, +, -, *, and /, are
        undoubtedly familiar to you. <br />
        This one may not be: <br />
        var whatsLeftOver = 10 % 3; <br />
        23 % is the modulus operator. <br />
        It doesn't give you the result of dividing one number by another. It
        gives you the remainder when the division is executed. <br />
        If one number divides evenly into another, the modulus operation returns
        0. In the following statement, 0 is assigned to the variable. <br />
        var whatsLeftOver = 9 % 3; -->
